Introduction to Git and GitHub

Learned about the importance of version control in tracking changes and coordinating with fellow developers. 
Explored the three types of Version Control Systems (VCS): Local, Centralized, and Distributed, and understood why Git is preferred among them. 
Learned how to use Git and GitHub to push code from your local system to a remote repository, revert to previous code versions, and create and merge branches for experimentation.
